Methods that return `java.util.concurrent.Future` and its subclasses generally
indicate errors by returning a future that eventually fails.

If you donâ€™t check the return value of these methods, you will never find out if
they threw an exception.

Nested futures can also result in missed cancellation signals or suppressed
exceptions - see
[Avoiding Nested Futures](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/ListenableFutureExplained#avoid-nested-futures)
for details.
